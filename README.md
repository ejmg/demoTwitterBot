#demoTwitterBot

A repo that shows anyone can make a twitter bot! This specific bot uses Python with the Twitter API wrapper Tweepy to create a simple bot that shows the kind of data you can use from Twitter's API.

Specifically demonstrated within, from applied code, is how to get a user object, a set of tweet objects, how to use the Cursor method of Tweepy, and some of the various data fields of user/tweet objects.
